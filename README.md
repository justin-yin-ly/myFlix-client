# myFlix Client-side

myFlix is a single-page application that allows users to register an account to use an online movie database for viewing information about various movies,including the genres and directors. 
Users can register, update, and delete their accounts, as well as search for specific movies, and add or remove movies to and from a personal list of favorites.

## Using this App

To begin using any of the functionality of this app, you must first register an account using the "Sign Up" view. 
After signing up and logging in, you'll be able to view the database of movies, as well as manage your own account.
